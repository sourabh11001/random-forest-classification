# Random Forest Classification using Python

This project demonstrates how **Random Forest Classification** combines multiple decision trees to create a more accurate and stable predictive model. By using an ensemble of trees, Random Forest reduces overfitting and improves generalization compared to a single Decision Tree.

---

## 🔍 Objective
To implement and evaluate a **Random Forest Classifier** that predicts class labels using an ensemble of decision trees and majority voting.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**  
- **NumPy**, **Pandas** – data preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – data visualizations  
- **Scikit-learn** – Random Forest implementation and evaluation  

---

## 📊 Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Exploration** – understand dataset structure  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – cleaning, encoding, scaling  
3. **Model Training** – build and train the Random Forest Classifier  
4. **Prediction** – classify test samples  
5. **Evaluation** – Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report  
6. **Visualization** – feature importance plots and result visualizations  

---

## 📈 Results
The Random Forest model performs strongly by averaging predictions from multiple trees, reducing variance and improving classification accuracy.

## 🚀 Key Learnings
- How **ensemble learning** improves model performance  
- Understanding **bagging** and majority voting  
- Using **feature importance** to interpret results
